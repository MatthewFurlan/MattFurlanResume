<h1>The Best Movies According to Matt</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>LOTR Trilogy: Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return of the King</h3>
<p>The film adaptations from the beloved written works of J.R.R Tolkien, Each of these movies by themselves are worth watching for Peter Jackson's amazing vision as director, however they should be viewed as one single work having shot for a continuous 18 months in New Zeland.</p>
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>Rob Reiner at his best, this romance is anything but, it has sword fights, dungeons, giants, and magic. </p>
<h3>Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows part 2</h3>
<p>The ending to the series by J.K. Rowling, this movie has 8 years of pent up excitement that won't let you relax for nearly the entire movie. </p>
